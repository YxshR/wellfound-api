# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A Project & Task Management System with AI-powered assistant built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Gemini AI integration. The system provides a Kanban-style interface for managing projects and tasks, with intelligent AI features for task summarization and question-answering capabilities.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Project & Task Management System
- **Project**: A container for organizing related tasks with a name, description, and creation date
- **Task**: An individual work item within a project containing title, description, and status
- **Kanban Board**: A visual project management interface displaying tasks in columns representing different statuses
- **Column**: A vertical section on the Kanban board representing a task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Card**: The visual representation of a task on the Kanban board
- **AI Assistant**: The Gemini-powered component that provides task summarization and Q&A functionality
- **Frontend**: The React.js client application
- **Backend**: The Express.js server application
- **Database**: The MongoDB data storage system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

3. WHEN a user selects a project, THE System SHALL navigate to the project's Kanban board view
4. THE System SHALL allow users to update project names and descriptions
5. THE System SHALL allow users to delete projects and all associated tasks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to create and manage tasks within projects, so that I can track individual work items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL allow users to create tasks with title, description, and initial status within a selected project
2. THE System SHALL display all tasks for a project organized by their status columns
3. THE System SHALL allow users to update task titles, descriptions, and statuses
4. THE System SHALL allow users to delete individual tasks
5. WHEN a task is created, THE System SHALL assign it a default status of "To Do"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visual Kanban board interface, so that I can easily see and manage task progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL display tasks as cards within status columns on a Kanban board
2. THE System SHALL provide drag and drop functionality to move cards between columns
3. WHEN a card is moved to a different column, THE System SHALL update the task's status accordingly
4. THE System SHALL display key task information on each card including title and truncated description
5. THE System SHALL maintain the visual order of cards within columns across browser sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want AI-powered task analysis, so that I can get intelligent insights about my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide an AI summarization feature that analyzes all tasks in the current project
2. WHEN a user requests project summarization, THE System SHALL generate a concise summary using Gemini AI
3. THE System SHALL provide a question-and-answer interface for querying specific tasks or projects
4. WHEN a user asks a question about a task or project, THE System SHALL provide relevant AI-generated responses
5. THE System SHALL integrate with Google's Gemini API for all AI functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to persist across sessions, so that my work is never lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria
