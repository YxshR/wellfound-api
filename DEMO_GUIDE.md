## Demo Tips and Best Practices

### Preparation Tips

1. **Practice the flow** multiple times before the actual demo
2. **Prepare backup scenarios** in case of technical issues
3. **Have sample data ready** for a more impressive demonstration
4. **Test all features** beforehand to ensure they work
5. **Prepare answers** for common technical questions

### During the Demo

1. **Speak clearly** and explain what you're doing
2. **Highlight key features** as you demonstrate them
3. **Show, don't just tell** - let the audience see the functionality
4. **Be prepared for questions** and interruptions
5. **Keep the pace engaging** but not rushed

### Common Questions and Answers

#### "How does the AI integration work?"
"The system integrates with Google's Gemini AI API. When you request a summary or ask a question, we send the relevant project and task data as context to Gemini, which then provides intelligent insights based on that information. We also track token usage and provide cost estimates for transparency."

#### "Is this suitable for large teams?"
"The current version is designed for small to medium teams. The architecture is scalable, and we have plans for features like user authentication, role-based permissions, and real-time collaboration that would make it suitable for larger organizations."

#### "What about data security?"
"We implement several security measures including input validation, rate limiting, and secure API practices. For production deployments, we recommend using MongoDB Atlas with authentication and SSL/TLS encryption. The AI integration only sends project data necessary for analysis, not sensitive user information."

#### "Can it integrate with other tools?"
"The system is built with a RESTful API architecture, making it easy to integrate with other tools. We have plans for integrations with popular services like Slack, GitHub, and calendar applications."

#### "What's the deployment process like?"
"The application is designed for easy deployment on modern platforms like Vercel for the frontend and Railway for the backend. We provide comprehensive deployment guides and support Docker for containerized deployments."
